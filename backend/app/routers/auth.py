"""Authentication router — /me endpoint only.

Auth is handled entirely by Clerk (frontend SDK + Clerk-issued JWTs).
The legacy /register and /login endpoints have been removed because:
  1. They called hash_password() / create_access_token() which raise NotImplementedError.
  2. Having dead endpoints that 500 on every call is a liability (pentest surface).
  3. Clerk handles all credential management; we never store plaintext passwords.

The only endpoint we own is GET /me, which resolves the Clerk Bearer token
to our internal User row (auto-creating it on first API call).
